-   *Navigation Bar*

> *The navigation bar maintains consistency and professionalism across
> all pages of the website, ensuring a seamless browsing experience for
> visitors.This section includes the name and the logo which I designed
> myself using Paint, Photoshop, a picture and text merged together.*

-   *The hero image on the first page*

> *Images sourced from Pexels have been carefully selected to ensure
> optimal quality across various screen sizes. The initial wireframes
> (Fig 1) underwent slight modifications to accommodate this, as the
> initial image quality did not meet expectations. Subsequently, a more
> simplified layout (Fig 2) was adopted to enhance visual appeal and
> maintain consistency.*
