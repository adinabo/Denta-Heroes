 # Denta Heroes - a family dental practice

 **About the project**

 Denta Heroes is a website which serves as a valuable resource for
 individuals looking to learn more about our practice, including our
 location, contact details, and convenient appointment scheduling
 options. Whether you\'re a new patient seeking information about our
 services or a returning patient looking to book your next appointment,
 our user-friendly platform makes it easy to access the information you
 need. View the live website here https://adinabo.github.io/Denta-Heroes/index.html*

 ### FEATURES

## Denta Heroes - Home page (Page 1)

   **Navigation Bar**

 The navigation bar maintains consistency and professionalism across
 all pages of the website, ensuring a seamless browsing experience for
 visitors.This section includes the name and the logo which I designed
 myself using Paint, Photoshop, a picture and text merged together.

   **The hero image on the first page**

 Images sourced from Pexels have been carefully selected to ensure
 optimal quality across various screen sizes. The initial wireframes
 (Fig 1) underwent slight modifications to accommodate this, as the
 initial image quality did not meet expectations.

After researching other dental websites to understand what the audience wants, a more simplified layout (Fig 2) was adopted to enhance visual appeal and
 maintain consistency. I decided that adding a "Book Appointment" button makes it really easy for users to jump to the page they want.

 **About us Section**

 I incorporated some more images and a concise \"ABOUT US\" section to
 provide visitors with a glimpse into the identity and mission of the
 dental practice.

 Through these additions, Denta Heroes aims to offer a comprehensive
 overview of our practice and the exceptional dental care we provide.

 **The Testimonial Section**

 Our testimonial section features heartfelt feedback from three of our
 valued patients, highlighting their positive experiences and
 satisfaction with our services.

 These testimonials serve to reinforce our commitment to excellence
 and provide prospective patients with valuable insights into the
 quality of care they can expect at our practice.

 **Additional Dental Staff Images**

 You\'ll find two extra images from Pexels capturing our dental team
 hard at work in our practice. These candid shots give you a peek into
 the daily hustle and dedication of our staff as they provide top-notch
 care to our patients.

 I wanted to show patients the friendly faces behind our practice and
 our commitment to making your dental experience as comfortable and
 enjoyable as possible.

 **Footer**

 The footer layout mirrors the colors of the navigation bar, featuring
 shades of grey and blue for consistency throughout the website. It
 appears on every page, staying fixed at the bottom so visitors can
 easily access it by scrolling down. Within the footer, visitors will
 find our contact information, including our full address, opening
 hours, and links to our social media profiles.

 This user-friendly design ensures intuitive navigation, as users
 typically expect to find contact details conveniently located at the
 bottom of the page.

 ## Treatments Page (Page 2)
https://adinabo.github.io/Denta-Heroes/treatments.html

 The second page of Denta Heroes (Fig3) functions as both a price list and an
 informative resource for patients. Here, patients can explore the
 various treatments we offer and gain insights into what each treatment
 entails through embedded YouTube videos.

 By providing this comprehensive information, patients can better
 understand what to expect from their appointments, including the
 treatments available and the corresponding prices they may be quoted.

 The second page of Denta Heroes maintains the same layout as the
 first page, ensuring consistency in navigation and design elements.
 This includes the familiar structure of the navigation bar and footer,
 which remain unchanged throughout the website.

 By maintaining this cohesive layout, we aim to provide a seamless
 browsing experience for our visitors, allowing them to easily navigate
 between pages while accessing important information about our services
 and pricing.

 After consulting with my mentor, we decided to revise the initial
 wireframes (Fig 4) due to concerns that the design appeared too
 simple

 ## Book Appointment (Page 3)
  https://adinabo.github.io/Denta-Heroes/bookappointment.html

 The final page features a booking form where patients can
 conveniently schedule an appointment. The form includes standard
 fields such as name, telephone number, and email, along with options
 to select the services they\'re interested in.

 Additionally, there\'s a textarea where patients can express their
 concerns or specific needs in their own words.

 To maintain a concise yet lively atmosphere, I\'ve incorporated a
 background image featuring a smiling patient, adding a touch of
 vibrancy to the form (Fig 5)

 ## Testing
The website underwent testing on various devices, such as: desktop computers, tablets and some 
mobile devices such as iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPhone 12, Google Pixel 7, Samsung S21 and S23, and 
Huawei P40. 
Additionally, it was evaluated across different web browsers including Google Chrome, Mozilla 
Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. 
Feedback was collected from friends and family who were asked to navigated through the website,
and identify any possible bugs or simply express their honest opinion.

 ## Bugs
On IpadAir, the banner image occupies a significant amount of vertical space, resulting in an
aesthetically unpleasing layout. Specifically, there appears to be an excessive gap between the 
button and the jumbotron. 
Also, the picture of the first patient in the testimonials section seems to be slightly 
displaced downward when viewed on IpadAir and devices with similar width and height (820 x 1180).

The website was successfully deployed to GitHub. Steps to deploy it:

 1. Go to the Settings tab in the GitHub repository.
